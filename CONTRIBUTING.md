## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the Country Live Clocks Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [contact@ankitjha-webdev.com](mailto:contact@ankitjha-webdev.com).

## What we are looking for

We love contributions in several forms, including but not limited to:

- Bug reports
- Bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- Feature requests
- Feature implementations

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/ankitjha-webdev/CountryLiveClocks/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/ankitjha-webdev/CountryLiveClocks/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you do not see your idea listed, and you think it fits well with the goals of this project, do the following:

- **For a new feature or enhancement**: Post an issue describing your proposed change to the repo in question.
- **For something else**: Feel free to contribute in any way you like.

### Making changes

Great! Here are a few guidelines you should follow:

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it locally. Connect your local to the original ‘upstream’ repository by adding it as a remote. Pull in changes from ‘upstream’ often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely.
2. **Create a branch** for your edits.
3. **Use the npm package's coding style**. This is mostly standard JavaScript, but every project has its quirks.
4. **Reference any relevant issues or supporting documentation in your PR** (for example, “Closes #37.”).
5. **Write tests** that cover your changes.
6. **Make sure your changes pass any existing tests**. Run `npm test` to check.
7. **Write or adapt the documentation as needed** to reflect your changes.
8. **Submit a pull request** detailing your changes and any testing you have done.

### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository.

## Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ankitjha-webdev/CountryLiveClocks/issues). When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible about the issue. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

**Thanks again for your contribution, and happy coding!**
